Only in exceptional circumstances and under specific conditions do we issue refunds, as outlined below: \n\n CHANGE OF MIND: Before our writers/editors begin working on the project, the buyer is entitled to a complete refund. \n\n If you change your mind and decide to stop working with us after placing your order for whatever reason, you can request a refund within one hour of placing your order. In all other circumstances, a 15% processing fee will be applied. \n\n Customers are only entitled to a refund if they have exhausted all of the options listed below after the work has been delivered. \n\n If it fails to meet project specifications (as requested/documented by the customer). \n\n We are dedicated to ensuring that our customers are completely satisfied, and we offer unlimited changes to ensure that the delivery meets their expectations. To ensure complete satisfaction, we assign, re-assign, and re-write your job. You can save FREE Pages for the future, but they will have the same value, and you can use them at any moment. Suppose we are still unable to provide what you have requested. In that case, a refund will be issued based on a mutually agreed-upon percentage (but only in the cases where the delivery is entirely off the mark.) \n\n "LATE DELIVERY: We believe in "On-Time Delivery," but if we fail to deliver the requested service on time after three tries to contact us, your refund will be granted once it is shown by documentation evidence that the company caused the late delivery." \n\n Within 120 days of delivery, you must request a refund. Refund requests made after the deadline will not be considered. \n\n Customers should keep in mind the deadline for requesting a refund when placing an order`,
